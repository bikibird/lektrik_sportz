# Lektrik Sportz Game
## Toy Box Jam 3 entry
### A Captain NEAT-O Adventure
Let's get one thing straight. This is not Electric Footballâ„¢. Doctor Lamento destroyed the football years ago because, you know, he's evil. But, I get ahead of myself. This is the story of Captain NEAT-O who is far from home and falls into the clutches of Doctor Lamento.

The evil Doctor forces our hero to face off against his most formidable opponent, NEAT-O himself, in a spectacle the Doctor calls Lektrik Sportz Game (because he can't spell and, you know, he's evil.)

### Game Play
Run from one end of the field to the other while avoiding your opponents. You should make it home in under 5 minutes. Don't fall off.

Your teammates can help block the opponents and you can set their overall direction and confrontation style in the strategy session.

If you are using a keyboard to play, use the Z key to advance to the next screen/teammate and  the X key to switch modes in the strategy session.  Arrow keys select options, set direction, and move teammates.
